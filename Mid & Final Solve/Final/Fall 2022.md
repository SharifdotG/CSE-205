## 1. a. The worst time complexity to delete an array element is O(n) - Justification

The time complexity of deleting an element from an array can indeed be O(n), especially when the element to be deleted is not at the beginning or end of the array.

Let's consider an array of length n. When removing an element at index i, elements after index i need to be shifted by one position to fill the gap created by the removal. This shifting operation can take O(n) time in the worst case scenario.

### Example

Consider an array `[5, 8, 12, 7, 10]` and let's say we want to delete the element at index 2 (value 12).

Before deletion: `[5, 8, 12, 7, 10]`

After deletion: `[5, 8, _, 7, 10]`

The underscore (_) represents the gap created after removing 12. Elements after index 2 need to be shifted leftward to fill this gap:

Shifting elements: `[5, 8, 7, 7, 10]` ➡️ `[5, 8, 7, 10, _]`

In this case, elements had to be shifted, which took O(n) time as the number of elements after the deleted index influences the number of shifts needed.

### Diagram

```sql
Before Deletion:   [5, 8, 12, 7, 10]
                    ^  ^  ^
                    |  |  |
                  Index 2 |
                   Deleted
                   
After Deletion:    [5, 8, _, 7, 10]
                    ^  ^     ^
                    |  |     |
                  Index 2  Index 3 (shifted)

After Shifting:    [5, 8, 7, 10, _]
                    ^  ^  ^  ^
                    |  |  |  |
                  Index 2  Index 3
```

This shifting process, occurring when an element in the middle of the array is deleted, illustrates the potential time complexity of O(n) as the number of elements to shift increases proportionally with the array length.

### Pseudocode to Remove Duplicate Elements from Array

```plaintext
Function removeDuplicates(inputArray)
    Initialize an empty set to store unique elements
    Initialize an empty output array

    For each element in inputArray
        If the element is not in the set
            Add the element to the set
            Append the element to the output array

    Return the output array
End Function
```

### Example Code in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void removeDuplicates(int inputArray[], int size) {
    int uniqueSet[10] = {0}; // Assuming digits are within 0-9 range
    int outputArray[size];
    int outputSize = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (uniqueSet[inputArray[i]] == 0) {
            uniqueSet[inputArray[i]] = 1;
            outputArray[outputSize++] = inputArray[i];
        }
    }

    printf("Input Array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        printf("%d ", inputArray[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    printf("Output Array after removing duplicates: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < outputSize; ++i) {
        printf("%d ", outputArray[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int birthdayArray[] = {1, 7, 0, 8, 1, 9, 9, 2};
    int size = sizeof(birthdayArray) / sizeof(birthdayArray[0]);

    removeDuplicates(birthdayArray, size);

    return 0;
}
```

## 2. a. Scenario Where Interpolation Search May Not Work Efficiently Compared to Binary Search

### Scenario Where Interpolation Search May Not Work Efficiently Compared to Binary Search

Interpolation search is an improvement over binary search when the data is uniformly distributed. However, if the data is not uniformly distributed and has irregular gaps between elements, interpolation search may perform poorly and require more iterations compared to binary search.

Let's consider a scenario where the data is not uniformly distributed. We'll simulate a case where interpolation search faces challenges due to irregular data distribution.

### Pseudocode for Irregularly Distributed Data

```plaintext
Function irregularInterpolationSearch(array, target)
    low = 0
    high = length of array - 1
    
    while low <= high AND target is within array[low] and array[high]
        // Adjust the position using interpolation formula for irregular data
        position = low + ((target - array[low]) * (high - low) / (array[high] - array[low]))
        
        if array[position] == target
            return position // Element found at position
        
        if array[position] < target
            low = position + 1 // Update the search range
        
        else
            high = position - 1 // Update the search range
    
    return -1 // Element not found
End Function
```

### Simulation and Visualization

Consider an array with irregularly spaced elements: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`.

Let's suppose we are searching for the element `95` using both interpolation search and binary search:

#### Binary Search Steps

1. Initial Array: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`
2. Binary search iterations will divide the array in halves until the target is found or the search space reduces.

#### Interpolation Search Steps

1. Initial Array: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`
2. Due to irregular spacing, interpolation search will perform calculations to estimate the position of `95` in the array.
3. The calculated position may not accurately represent the location due to irregular data distribution, leading to more iterations to converge on the correct position or possibly overshooting.

                                              Final Position

Element Found at position (not accurately predicted)
```

In this irregular data scenario, interpolation search struggles to accurately estimate the positions due to the non-uniform distribution of elements, resulting in more iterations and possibly an inefficient search process compared to binary search.

## 3. a. Describe some advantages of Postfix expression over the Infix expression with diagrams

### Advantages of Postfix Expression over Infix Expression

#### 1. **Simplified Evaluation Process**

In Postfix notation, operators come after their operands, leading to a straightforward evaluation process without the need for parentheses or precedence rules. This simplifies the evaluation algorithm.

```makefile
Infix:  (a + b) * c
Postfix: a b + c *
```

#### 2. **Elimination of Parentheses**

Postfix expressions don't require parentheses to denote the order of operations. This eliminates ambiguity and simplifies expression parsing.

```makefile
Infix:  (a + b) * (c - d)
Postfix: a b + c d - *
```

#### 3. **Reduced Complexity**

Postfix notation reduces the complexity associated with parsing and evaluating expressions. It's easier to implement an algorithm for postfix evaluation compared to infix due to its linear structure.

#### Visual Comparison

```r
Infix:  (a + b) * c

   a
    \
     +
    / \
   b   c
```

```r
Postfix: a b + c *

   a   b
    \ /
     +
    / \
   c   *
```

The postfix expression's tree structure shows a more direct evaluation flow without nested structures, making it simpler to evaluate.

#### Conclusion

Postfix notation offers a more streamlined and efficient way to represent and evaluate mathematical expressions, especially in terms of reducing complexity, eliminating ambiguity, and simplifying the evaluation process.

## 3. b. Using Stack data structure convert the following... - Solve

### Infix to Postfix Conversion Steps

#### Expression: `K + L - M * N + (O ^ P + Z) * W / U / V * T + Q`

1. **Initialize** an empty stack and an empty postfix expression.
2. **Scan** the infix expression from left to right.
3. **Process each token** (operands, operators, parentheses) based on certain rules:
   - If the token is an operand (like K, L, M, etc.), add it directly to the postfix expression.
   - If the token is an operator (+, -, *, /, ^), follow the precedence rules to decide its position in the postfix expression.
   - If the token is an opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is a closing parenthesis, pop operators from the stack and add them to the postfix expression until an opening parenthesis is found.

#### Conversion Steps

| **Token** | **Action**                     | **Stack**       | **Postfix Expression** |

## 4. a. Why is recursion important in Data structure? Write some examples on it

### Importance of Recursion in Data Structures

Recursion is a fundamental concept in data structures that offers several advantages, enhancing the efficiency and simplicity of solving problems. It plays a crucial role in various data structure operations and algorithms due to its ability to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

#### 1. **Solving Complex Problems:**

Recursion simplifies problem-solving by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more understandable sub-problems. For instance, consider sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort. They use recursion to divide the sorting process into smaller subarrays, making it easier to manage and sort.

#### 2. **Tree and Graph Traversal:**

Recursion is vital in traversing complex data structures like trees and graphs. Algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Tree Traversal (e.g., Inorder, Preorder, Postorder) heavily rely on recursive techniques. Recursive approaches simplify navigating through nodes or vertices, enabling efficient exploration of these structures.

#### 3. **Divide and Conquer:**

Many efficient algorithms follow the "divide and conquer" paradigm, which involves breaking a problem into smaller, similar subproblems until they become simple enough to solve straightforwardly. Recursion facilitates this process, allowing for a more elegant and understandable solution. For instance, binary search applies this principle to search for an element in a sorted array.

#### Example: Factorial Calculation

Let's explore a simple example of calculating factorial using recursion:

```plaintext
Function factorial(n):
    If n is 0 or 1:
        Return 1
    Else:
        Return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Visualization:

```scss
factorial(4)
    ↓
4 * factorial(3)
            ↓
        3 * factorial(2)
                    ↓
                2 * factorial(1)
                            ↓
                        1 * factorial(0)
                                    ↓
                                1 (Base case reached)
```

This recursive approach breaks down the factorial calculation into smaller multiplications until it reaches the base case (factorial of 0 or 1), simplifying the computation.

Recursion, with its ability to break down problems and handle repetitive tasks effectively, is an integral part of data structures, making algorithms more intuitive and elegant.

## 4. b. Develop the following series using recursion: 0 1... - Solve

### Code in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int solve(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2) {
        return n;
    }

    return solve(n - 1) + solve(n - 2) + solve(n - 3) + 1;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", solve(i));
    }

    return 0;

## 5. a. Write the cases where using arrays provides advantages instead of linked lists

### Advantages of Arrays over Linked Lists

Arrays and linked lists are both fundamental data structures, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Here are some scenarios where using arrays provides advantages over linked lists:

#### Constant-Time Access

Arrays allow constant-time access to elements if the index is known. In contrast, linked lists require traversing from the head or tail, resulting in linear time complexity for accessing an element at a particular index.

```plaintext
Array Access:
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Accessing arr[2] directly provides element 30 in O(1) time.

Linked List Access:
LinkedList: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50
To access the element at index 2, the list must be traversed from the head node, taking O(n) time.
```

#### Cache Friendliness

Arrays exhibit better cache locality due to their contiguous memory allocation. This characteristic leads to more efficient usage of CPU caches compared to linked lists, where elements are scattered in memory.

```plaintext
Array:
Memory: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Adjacent elements are stored together in memory, making better use of CPU caches.

Linked List:
Memory: Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> Node4 -> Node5
Nodes are scattered in memory, leading to poorer cache performance.
```

#### Efficient Random Access and Arithmetic Operations

Arrays are beneficial for performing arithmetic operations directly on elements and allow direct access based on the index, enabling efficient mathematical computations or algorithms.

```plaintext
Array Arithmetic:
arr = [5, 10, 15, 20]
Computing arr[2] + arr[3] = 15 + 20 = 35 can be done directly.

Linked List Arithmetic:
LinkedList: 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20
Performing arithmetic operations requires traversal, making it less efficient for direct computation.
```

#### Space Efficiency

In some cases, arrays can be more memory-efficient compared to linked lists due to their lower memory overhead. Linked lists require extra memory for storing pointers/references to the next node, which can lead to higher memory consumption.

```plaintext
Array Memory Utilization:
An array might use less memory since it doesn’t need extra pointers for linking elements.

Linked List Memory Utilization:
Linked lists use extra memory for pointers/references, increasing overall memory consumption.
```

### Diagrams Illustrating the Differences

#### Array

```sql
| 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |
```

#### Linked List

```sql
Node1: 10 -> Node2: 20 -> Node3: 30 -> Node4: 40 -> Node5: 50
```

These scenarios demonstrate situations where arrays are more advantageous over linked lists, primarily in terms of constant-time access, cache friendliness, arithmetic operations, and sometimes space efficiency. However, linked lists offer advantages in dynamic memory allocation and insertion/deletion at arbitrary positions. The choice between arrays and linked lists depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application.

## 5. b. Write the cases where using arrays provides advantages instead of linked lists

### Algorithm to Insert at the Beginning and Delete Last K Nodes in a Linked List

```plaintext
Function insertDeleteLinkedList(head, m, k):
    Initialize a new node with value m
    Set the new node's next to the current head
    Set head to the new node

    Initialize a pointer p1 to head
    Initialize a pointer p2 to head

    Repeat k times:
        Move pointer p2 k steps ahead

    While p2's next is not None:
        Move p1 and p2 simultaneously
        Update p2's next until p2 reaches the end

    Set p1's next to p2's next
    Return the updated head

End Function
```

### Example and Visualization

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

def insert_delete_linked_list(head, m, k):
    new_node = Node(m)
    new_node.next = head
    head = new_node

    p1 = head
    p2 = head

    for _ in range(k):
        p2 = p2.next

    while p2.next is not None:
        p1 = p1.next
        p2 = p2.next

    p1.next = p2.next
    return head

# Create a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
head = Node(1)
current = head
for i in range(2, 8):
    current.next = Node(i)
    current = current.next

# Visual representation before operation: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
# Inserting 8 at the beginning and deleting last 3 nodes
head = insert_delete_linked_list(head, 8, 3)

# Visualization after operation: 8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```

### Diagram for Visualization

```yaml
Before Operation:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7

After Inserting 8 and Deleting Last 3 Nodes:
8 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```

This pseudocode inserts a new node at the beginning of the linked list with value m and then deletes the last k nodes from the list.

## 6. a. Write the cases where using a linked list provides advantages instead of arrays

### Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays

Using a **Linked List** provides advantages over arrays in various scenarios:

#### 1. Dynamic Size

- **Linked List:** Easily accommodates dynamic size changes by allocating memory as needed. Adding or removing elements doesn't require shifting elements as in arrays, ensuring efficient operations.

   Diagram:

   ```css
   [Node 1] -> [Node 2] -> [Node 3] -> ... -> [Node N]
   ```

#### 2. Insertion and Deletion

- **Linked List:** Allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations at any position without rearranging elements. Only pointer manipulation is required.

   Diagram (Insertion):

   ```css
   Before: [Node A] -> [Node B] -> [Node C]
   After Inserting X between B and C: [Node A] -> [Node B] -> [Node X] -> [Node C]
   ```

#### 3. Memory Allocation

- **Linked List:** Allocates memory dynamically for each node, avoiding the need for contiguous memory allocation. Ideal for situations where memory allocation is limited or unpredictable.

   Diagram:

   ```css
   [Node 1] -> [Node 2] -> [Node 3] -> ... -> [Node N]
   ```

#### 4. Efficiency in Operations

- **Linked List:** Offers constant-time insertion and deletion at the beginning (with a head pointer), whereas arrays might require shifting elements.

   Diagram:

   ```css
   Before Deletion: [Node A] -> [Node B] -> [Node C]
   After Deleting A: [Node B] -> [Node C]
   ```

Linked lists excel in scenarios where frequent insertion/deletion and a dynamic size are required, while arrays are advantageous for random access and fixed-size structures.

## 6. b. Given a linked list and two integers m and k. Write a ... - Solve

### Algorithm

```plaintext
1. Define a Node structure for the linked list:
    Node {
        value
        next
    }

2. Define a function insertAtEnd(value):
    - Create a new node with the given value.
    - If the linked list is empty:
        - Set the head of the linked list to the new node.
    - Else:
        - Traverse the list to the last node.
        - Set the next of the last node to the new node.

3. Define a function deleteFirstKNodes(k):
    - If the linked list is empty or k is 0, return.
    - Set a temporary node as the head of the linked list.
    - Iterate k times:
        - If the temporary node is null, break.
        - Move the temporary node to the next node.
    - Set the head of the linked list as the node after the temporary node.

4. Main procedure:
    - Call insertAtEnd(m) to insert a node with value m at the end of the list.
    - Call deleteFirstKNodes(k) to delete the first k nodes from the list.
```

### Diagrammatic Representation

#### Initial Linked List

```sql
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
```

#### After Inserting Node with Value `m`

```sql
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> m -> NULL
```

#### After Deleting First `k` Nodes

Suppose `k = 2`.

```sql
3 -> 4 -> 5 -> m -> NULL
```

This algorithm assumes a basic singly linked list structure and provides a clear guideline to insert a node with value `m` at the end and then delete the first `k` nodes from the linked list.
