# CSE 205 - Data Structures

This repo is for the **CSE 205: Data Structures** course at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Asia Pacific. This repository contains codes and implementations of Data Structures in the course. It also contains the solutions of **Mid and Final** Exams of **Spring 2023, 2022 and Fall 2022**.

## Course Description

This course is designed to provide students with a solid foundation in the principles of data structures and algorithms (Mainly Data Structures). The course will cover the basic data structures such as **arrays, recusions, writing pseudocodes, linked lists, stacks and queues**. The course will also cover the basic algorithms such as **searching and sorting**. All the data structures will be implemented in **both C and C++ programming language**.
